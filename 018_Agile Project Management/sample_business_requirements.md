# Title

## Executive Summary

*This project is developed in relation to the Coder Camps requirements for the keystone project of the bootcamp. It is the brainchild of the developer of this project in an effort to acquire a better knowledge of the .NET Core Entity Framework using C#. This project will teach the student about the uses of the Entity Framework and Identity Framework. In addition, the student will learn security of particular areas within the framework.*

## Business Objectives

*The main objective of this web application is to build and distribute a newer model of e-commerce to the public. It will provide a complete and concise operation for the end-user unlike most web e commerce stores available. This will not be your typical “out-of-the-box” free software available. It will build to become an e-commerce that will provide options for all available pay portals as well as the ability to change the look of the store based on the needs of the end-user.*

## Background

*Customers are looking for a concise and easy to navigate system to make their online purchase. These sites should provide a fun, narrative, and pleasant environment in which customers will want to return for future purchases.*

## Scope

*The initial project will include the display of products along with images and descriptions of each. It will also include user and admin login for each area. The user will be required to login upon making a purchase and will not be able to access the admin are. However, the admin will be allowed to have access to all CRUD and user functions. Future development of a shopping cart will be added along with possible “skins” for changing the look based on the application’s end-user needs.*

## Functional requirements

*The end result of this project will lead to a full-use e-commerce site. The functionality of this web application will include browsing of the store products to allow choices among them for the consumer. The front page will also display a “timely special” and featured products. 
As the consumer browses through the site the will have the opportunity to click on individual product to view a larger image and detailed information of the product. Both, thumbnail and detail views will allow for placing the item into a basket for future checkout. Once the consumer has made their choices they will be able to register or login and complete the purchase through the shopping cart which is derived from the basket.
The site will also provide information to the consumer such as information about the store along with a means of contacting the manager of the store for issues or further information.
The administrator, upon verification, will have access to Add, Delete, Modify and View (CRUD) any item, category. Payment portal, or user of the site. In future modifications to the web application, statistical information will be provided to the site administrator to indicate which items are performing better than others as well as maintenance of users as issues arise.*


## Personnel requirements

*This particular project will involve a team of 3 people, collaborating on the needs and requirements of the completion of the program.*

## Delivery schedule

*Production Requirements
Product manager creates requirements documents that include the following requirements (in order of priority):
•	Proper display of items based on their particular status
•	CRUD functions established for the Admin
•	CRUD functions established for consumer in shopping cart
•	User ability to create and login to new account
•	Admin ability to login to back-end of the store
Timeframe: 1 week

Timeframe: 3 weeks
Implementation
Develop the front end of the initial application for demonstrative purposes. Develop functionality and prepare for testing.
Timeframe: 2 weeks
Software Product Testing
Team tests entire application for functionality.
Timeframe: 1 week
Release
The final product functionality is released
TOTAL elapsed time: 8 weeks

## Other requirements

*The initial rollout of this application is for demonstration purposes alone and will not reflect the full functionality of the finalized product. This application has been developed for a term project for the Coder Camps final project.*

## Assumptions

*Reliability of the program exists within its framework as well as the availability of the internet and hosting hardware. The application is built around the Google APIs as well as Twitter Bootstrap which are hosted on separate website CDNs to reduce load times of the initial application.*

## Limitations

*Limitations of the scope of this project could arise from unforeseen events such as sickness or other unplanned events. Preparation of such events should be thought out and the team members should be able to step in and cover for such events. Also, there is the possibility of computer or other electrical failure which could add additional time to the timeframe established.*

## Risks

*Inherent risks of the project could be from the failure of electronic components or an accidental deletion of the project. These risks are minimized by the use of github and redundant backups on a set time frame in order to establish a method in which to recover from these risks.*
